# Student Performance Dataset

## Introduction
This dataset contains information about student performance in exams along with various demographic and background attributes. The dataset includes the following attributes:

- Gender: Sex of students (Male/Female)
- Race/Ethnicity: Ethnicity of students (Group A, B, C, D, E)
- Parental Level of Education: Parents' final education (Bachelor's Degree, Some College, Master's Degree, Associate's Degree, High School)
- Lunch: Whether the student has standard or free/reduced lunch
- Test Preparation Course: Whether the student completed a test preparation course before the exam
- Math Score
- Reading Score
- Writing Score

## Data Source
The data was collected from [source link or description of data source].

## Data Preprocessing
